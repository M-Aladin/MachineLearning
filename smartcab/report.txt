QUESTION: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?

There aren't many observations to notice, except for the fact that the smartcab drives in circles.
I've run the test 5 times for 1000 trials each and got the following results:

Trials 		| Success | Ran Out of time | Hard Deadline
1. 1000 		682 		475 			318
2. 1000 		666 		460 			334
3. 1000 		655 		474 			345
4. 1000 		678 		476 			322
5. 1000 		652 		426 			348

Success rate if we don't enforce the deadline (<= 100 moves) - 66.66%, if we enforce the deadline it is 20.4%.
